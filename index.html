    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section id="about-section">
      <p>
        I'm a freelance developer living in the golden state of California.
        I spend most of my time working on user content for the well-known
        rhythm game engine Project OutFox, gaming on Twitch, or using my hard
        earned quarters to buy a soda from the closest gas station.
        <br>
        A lot of my experience with coding and development comes from self-study.
        I've been passionate about programming since I was about 12 years old
        seeing the things my dad would work on in the living room at his desk.
        Ever since I've spent most of my years learning as much as I could on how
        to make that same 3D box from scratch in C++ and OpenGL. I'm currently
        studying at Full Sail University to get my Bachelor's in Game Development.
        My biggest goal in life is to play a game in the Legend of Zelda series
        with my mom, get to the credits, and point at my name, saying "That's
        <em>me</em>."
        <br>
        To be honest, if you were expecting to see some grand wall of achievements,
        I'm sorry to disappoint you. It's the small wins that I like to celebrate,
        and honestly, I'm not really all that privileged being in so many minority
        categories. I'm black, I'm trans, I'm poor, and I'm hungry. Please buy me a
        pizza. I prefer something like Mountain Mike's or Old Town Pizza. Don't get
        me that pineapple nonsense. It's just weird.
